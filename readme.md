# dotfiles

Fork this repo and clone it to your home directory so that you get `~/dotfiles`.

Don't forget to:
- edit `git/.gitconfig` to replace my name and email with yours
- Remove the dev bit in `shell/path.sh`

Run `sh setup.sh` to set everything up.

**Note**: On Windows, you'll need to run the script using [Git Bash for Windows](https://git-for-windows.github.io).
